# OCaml Minesweeper

The project depends on [dune](https://github.com/ocaml/dune), [menhir](https://github.com/LexiFi/menhir), and the [ANSITerminal](https://github.com/Chris00/ANSITerminal) library.

Install the dependencies to your `opam` switch:
```bash
opam install dune menhir ANSITerminal
```

Run the game:
```bash
dune exec minesweeper
```

Enjoy!
